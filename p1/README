[ HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW ]
At its current state, our program is capable of recognizing certain all
provided keywords that were specified in the GLSL documentation (the 
highlighted ones), as well as some of the ones that came in the starter
code.

Some things we noticed that were quite challenging was constructing some
of the regular expressions. For example, it took quite a bit of thought
to construct a sufficient expression for the 'float' type. Additionally,
we found the instructions to be a little vague which caused a lot of
confusion when working on the project.

For the design decisions, we elected to follow the advice of our fellow
peers who posted on Piazza. For example, we were unsure of how to handle
and integer with a minus sign in front of it. Looking at Piazza 
(piazza.com/class/ihrbfc16rae4j0?cid=119), we determined that GLSL does not
store negative numbers in the integer constant. Instead we recognize the
symbol as an operator, and the number as a positive number.

We believe our program is correct and robust because of how closely we
followed the detailed instruction the professor provided in lecture, through
his posts on Piazza, as well as the 'samples' tests that were provided.

With our hard work and dedication, we hope to receive a high deserving grade
in this assignment. In terms of error handling, we throw three different
errors: one for identifier length exceeding 1023; one for an unclosed
multi-line comment; and finally one for unrecognized characters. One thing
to note, we did not add the string terminating error because we are not
dealing with strings in this assignment (thankfully). :)
